three-ideas about the final projet from Zhu Man and Huishan
===========
 Idea One:
          A Language Learning Game: use keys to catch the falling words 

Description: players will use keys to control the figure’s motion, try their best to let the figure capture correct words for scoring. If users get a wrong word (when catching wrong ones, some changes will take place on the figure), points will be off. If the score shows zero, game will be over. 

Research Question: we find it meaningful to write the codes which allow the player to control the figure in the game by using the keyboard as it is an important way to involve players into a program, stimulate interaction and collect feedbacks. 

Educational Implication: Learning languages especially foreign ones is a long and painful process, filled with a lot of practice and repeating recitation. As games can “use technology to represent reality or embody fantasy” (Becta, 2001), inspire learners who lack interest or confidence, and add fun to the tedious process, and largely motivate language learners’ initiatives, we would like to design a language learning mini game, helping children and foreigners to learn a language (considering the designers’ background, the database will cover English and Chinese).

For more information, please see the specific sketch.


Idea Two:
         An efficiency and time management program
         
Research Question: Procrastination is too familiar to most people. People would like to put off what they should do today till tomorrow, and when the deadline approaches, they start to blame themselves for their procrastination. Putting up any epigram? Or let your friends make supervision? None of those work out. One effective way is to remind procrastinator the value of time, making a balance between their “subjective time” and the objective time. Besides, the reason of procrastination can be due to the fear of failure and the complication of tasks. 

Description: design a program to help users overcome procrastination through reminding them the left time, the ongoing tasks. It’s a little like the apps of Tomato Timer but our design will make use of the advantages of processing to emphasize the visual effect and mix more fun into the game. 

Specific display: First users will be requested to set the expected time (in hours) to finish their task and input their tasks. Then the program will change the time into minutes, reveal them via a sunflower clock and then take advantage of a zombie to remind you how much time is left. For instance, you first set an hour to fulfill your task. Every ten minutes pass, the zombie will eat one sunflower, showing that you now have 50 minutes to do your tasks. 


Idea Three:
         Game: control a cartoon figure to jump to different boards

Description: the player uses the keyboard to control the cartoon figure to jump to different floating boards in the game window. If the cartoon figure fails to land on a board, he will fall to the ground, which symbolizes the end of the game. More interestingly, the floating boards could be crispy so that even if the cartoon figure successfully lands on the boards, he could fall as well. 

Research Question: it may be hard to calculate the distance between the floating boards as well as decide the conditions when the boards will be crispy. 

Further Research: as long as we figure out the way to enhance the interaction between players and the game, it could be used to develop educational programs to help players learn new knowledge through the process of playing a game.
