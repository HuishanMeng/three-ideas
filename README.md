three-ideas about the final projet from Zhu Man and Huishan
===========
 Idea One:   A Language Learning Game: use keys to catch the falling words 

Description: players will use keys to control the figure’s motion, try their best to let the figure capture correct words for scoring. If users get a wrong word (when catching wrong ones, some changes will take place on the figure), points will be off. If the score shows zero, game will be over. 

Research Question: we find it meaningful to write the codes which allow the player to control the figure in the game by using the keyboard as it is an important way to involve players into a program, stimulate interaction and collect feedbacks. 

Educational Implication: Learning languages especially foreign ones is a long and painful process, filled with a lot of practice and repeating recitation. As games can “use technology to represent reality or embody fantasy” (Becta, 2001), inspire learners who lack interest or confidence, and add fun to the tedious process, and largely motivate language learners’ initiatives, we would like to design a language learning mini game, helping children and foreigners to learn a language (considering the designers’ background, the database will cover English and Chinese).
