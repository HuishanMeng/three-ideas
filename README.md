three-ideas about the final projet from Zhu Man and Huishan
===========
 Idea One:
 A Language Learning Game: use keys to catch the falling words 

Description: players will use keys to control the figure’s motion, try their best to let the figure capture correct words for scoring. 
If users get a wrong word (when catching wrong ones, some changes will take place on the figure), points will be off. If the score shows zero, game will be over.
